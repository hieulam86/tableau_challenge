# CitiBike Data Analysis

## Data Collection and Cleaning
  I collected the data between 01/2022 and 12/2022 from the https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html.

  Then I combined the 12 files for each month. I dropped any null values rows. Finally, I exported a cleaned csv file called "combined_citibike_data".
