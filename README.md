# CitiBike Data Analysis

## Data Collection and Cleaning
  I gathered data spanning from January 2022 to December 2022 from https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html.

  Subsequently, I merged the 12 files corresponding to each month, eliminating any rows with null values. Finally, I exported a refined CSV file named "combined_citibike_data."
